# ChatBot-Using-LangChain
Langsmith used to monitor the LLM: This chatbot application is designed using the LangChain framework, OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, and Streamlit for a web interface. Below are the key components and their roles in the application.
##  1.Environment Setup and API Keys
The application uses environment variables to securely manage API keys like OPENAI_API_KEY and LANGCHAIN_API_KEY. These keys are critical for accessing OpenAI's language models and enabling LangSmith tracking features (LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2), which are useful for monitoring and debugging your chatbot's performance.
## 2.LangChain Integration
LangChain: The application leverages LangChain's ChatOpenAI class to interact with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. LangChain provides a structured way to build language model applications, allowing for better management of prompts and output processing.
ChatPromptTemplate: The prompt is structured using ChatPromptTemplate, which defines a template for the interaction between the system (assistant) and the user. The template includes system instructions and a user prompt placeholder ({question}), which is dynamically populated with user input.
## 3.Streamlit for User Interaction:
Streamlit Interface: The application uses Streamlit to create a simple and interactive web interface. The st.text_input widget captures the user's query, and the st.write function displays the model's response. This setup allows users to input their questions and receive responses directly on a web page.
Real-Time Interaction: The application listens for user input and, upon receiving a query, processes it through the LangChain pipeline to generate and display a response. This real-time interaction is facilitated by Streamlit's reactive design.
## 4.Pipeline for Query Processing:
Prompt Template -> LLM -> Output Parser: The application creates a processing pipeline where the user's query is passed through the ChatPromptTemplate, processed by the OpenAI language model (LLM), and then parsed by the StrOutputParser. This pipeline ensures that the response is correctly formatted and ready for display.
## 5.Model Selection:
The application uses the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model, which is known for its strong conversational abilities. The model is accessed via LangChain's ChatOpenAI class, allowing seamless integration with the rest of the LangChain ecosystem.
## 6.LangSmith Tracking:
LangSmith: By setting the LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2 environment variable, the application enables LangSmith tracking. This feature helps in monitoring the interactions and performance of the chatbot, providing insights that can be used for further optimization.

### Summary of the Application:
This application is a sophisticated yet straightforward implementation of a chatbot using the latest tools from LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. It efficiently handles user queries by leveraging a well-structured prompt, processes the input through a powerful language model, and displays the response in an intuitive web interface. The use of environment variables and LangSmith tracking adds an additional layer of security and monitoring, making it a robust solution for building AI-driven applications.
